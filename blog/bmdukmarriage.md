## Searching for records of Marriage's in England and Wales

Their are many websites that are free to use for family history research.

The website I use is to search for records of births is [<span style="color:blue">freebmd</span>](https://www.freebmd.org.uk).

Once you have found the record of birth, it will supply you with the mother's maiden name, for records after 1910.

You can now start to look for their parent's record of marriage.

It can usually be found about two years before the birth of their first child.
