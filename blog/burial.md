## How to find where a Jewish person is buried in London uk

The first thing to do is, search the records for the year of death, on [<span style="color:blue">freebmd</span>](https://www.freebmd.org.uk).

Once you have found the year and spelling of the person you're looking for.

 You can start to look for where they are buried.

I have all the links to the Jewish burial societies indexes, on my website at [<span style="color:blue">family-history.tips</span>](https://family-history.tips/Jewish/british).
